# testApp
A playground for learning Javascript/Typescript and React/React Native

## Planned elements
These are some of the ideas I have right this second that would allow me to explore the concepts
- [ ] simple front page with text that changes upon login
- [ ] basic login form
- [ ] account screen with text boxes for information
- [ ] some type of database (file?) to store the user information
- [ ] make this app available on the web and on iOS
